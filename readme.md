BlockedServers/tracker
----------------------

Mojang has recently started blocking certain servers that violate the EULA, this repository intends to track changes to this blocklist.

This repository is being updated every five minutes, and it attempts to utilize the dictionary in `support/dictionary` to determine which server(s)
have been blocked by Mojang.

Feel free to open a PR to add servers to the dictionary that have not been tracked yet.
